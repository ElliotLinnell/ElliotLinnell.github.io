            <p>Oasis is one of the most successful and influential rock bands to emerge from the UK in the 1990s. Formed in Manchester in 1991, the band was led by the Gallagher brothers—Liam (vocals) and Noel (lead guitar, songwriter)—and became pioneers of the Britpop movement. Their music, heavily inspired by classic rock bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Who, resonated with a generation seeking anthems of youth and rebellion.</p>

            <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
            <p>Oasis' raw energy, catchy melodies, and rebellious attitude made them the voice of a generation. Their ongoing feud with Blur fueled the famous Britpop rivalry of the 90s. Despite lineup changes and internal tensions, the band's music has stood the test of time. They sold over 75 million records worldwide before disbanding in 2009 after years of public disputes between the Gallagher brothers.

                Today, Oasis is remembered as one of the most iconic bands in British music history, with their songs continuing to inspire both fans and new generations of musicians.</p>
